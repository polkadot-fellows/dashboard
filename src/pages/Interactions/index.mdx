## Process Flow

Below is a comprehensive depiction, following a member's journey from induction, showcasing the various stages they undergo within the fellowship.

### [Becoming a Polkadot Technical Fellowship Member](https://polkadot-fellows.github.io/dashboard/#/membership)

Please refer to the overview page.

### Salary Cycle Initialization, Induction & Continuance

The salary pallet has been [initiated](https://collectives.statescan.io/#/extrinsics/2983655-2), members can now `induct` themselves into the payroll cycle(i.e. 30DAY periods)

After an elapsed cycle, any account may call `bump` to move to the next cycle, this is required before calls to `register` for payment of the elasped cycle and subsequently calls to claim `payout` is possible.

### Approval

Members of ranks I through VI are required to re-approve their ranks before their respective demotion periods elapses, as configured in the runtime[here](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/issues/111#issuecomment-1872941849).

An evidence detailing a members involvement in the fellowship is submitted at a time before calling `approve`, subsequently the evidence should be sumbitted in the referandum description.

Any account on the collectives system chain can submit a preimage of the call `approve` for ranked members of the fellowship in the appropriate track.

The preimage needs to be submitted to the 11 / Retain At I Dan for approval of the member's rank retention. This process will update the last_proof with the block number at which the call is executed.

### Payment Registration

Members should register for salary at the end of the current payroll cycle(i.e. 30DAYS) and within the `RegistrationPeriod`(i.e. within 15DAYS after the current payroll cycle).

### Claim Salary

After a combination of the payroll cycle and `RegistrationPeriod` have elapsed(i.e. 30DAYS + 15DAYS) members can begin claiming salary within the `PayoutPeriod`(i.e. within 15DAYS), with a call to `payout`.

Alternatively members can claim payout to any account on the collectives system chain(i.e. `payout_other`).

### Retriying Failed Payments

In the event of failed payments members can call `check_payment` to retry within the same cycle.
